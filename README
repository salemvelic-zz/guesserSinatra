In this introductory level project, I will use Sinatra to build a number guessing game.
Goals

It will:

    Generate a random number on startup
    Have a web page where you can enter a guess
    Tell you whether your guess wasâ€¦
        Way too high
        Too high
        Correct
        Too low
        Way too low
